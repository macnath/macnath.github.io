    <h3>I don't know how to say it exactly. Only...I want to die as myself. I don't want them to change me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not. I keep wishing I could think of a way to...to show the Capitol that they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their Games."
        ―Peeta Mellark to Katniss Everdeen</h3>
    <h4>Peeta Mellark, a baker's son from District 12, is one of the main characters of the The Hunger Games trilogy. He is a very compassionate person and is good with words. He has been in love with Katniss Everdeen since the age of 5, but never confessed his feelings until he was reaped alongside her for the 74th Hunger Games. He and Katniss play out a romance in the arena in order to garner sponsors and manage to both become victors by tricking the Gamemakers. Although his feelings are genuine, he is hurt to discover that Katniss' were not entirely. He and Katniss become friends despite the fact that they are forced to use their fake romance to both placate and subvert the capitol during their Victory Tour and the 75th Hunger Games. At the end of the 75th Games, Peeta is captured by the Capitol and hijacked to believe that Katniss is an evil muttation. He manages to fall in love with her all over again during the end of the war and the years afterwards. Eventually, Katniss realizes that she is also in love with him, and they have two children (it is unclear whether or not they are married)."</h4>
    
    
    
    <h2>Johanna Mason</h2>
    
    <h4>"Well, hell yes, I'm angry. You know, I'm getting totally screwed over here. The deal was that if I win the Hunger Games, I get to live the rest of my life in peace. But now, you want to kill me again. Well, you know what? ---- THAT! AND ---- EVERYBODY THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT! "
        ―Johanna Mason, angrily to the Capitol</h4>
        <h4>Johanna Mason of District 7 is the victor of the 71st Hunger Games.[1] Four years after her triumph, she was the only living female victor from her district, and thus was reaped for the third Quarter Quell. Besides Katniss and Peeta, she was the youngest tribute in the Quarter Quell, being 21. She is the last living victor of District 7 at the end of the trilogy.</h4>
